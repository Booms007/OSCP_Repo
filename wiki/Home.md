This is a wiki for tracking my documentation as I move through the Offensive Security Certified Penetration testing certification.

Documentation is a key area of penetration testing. This wiki is an exercise in breaking down and tracking my efforts to learn every detail of the material. If you find this material helpful or would like to contribute drop me a line.

I also encourage anyone viewing this material to point out errors that you come across in the documentation. This will benefit my learning process, as well as any users that come across this repository in the pursuit of the OSCP.

I wish everyone out there the best of luck in the pursuit of the OSCP.

Try Harder! :c)
